# Are there any threads for this thing?

None. And I don't plan on making one. Just pull up requests on github or email me (Look At Bottom).


# What do I need to run this thing?

If you're on windows, nothing. Because it's a command line tool, windows users can use it directly. Until unless you want to use the python scripts, which are available in this github repository.

As for Linux/Mac users, your best option is to use this python script. This script will be supported on Python 2.7.x.

# How do I do what I have to do? (Simple Guide)
   
   # For Windows/Command Line :

    0.) Extract the conents of the EXE you just downloaded somewhere on your hard drive.
    1.) Open CMD and browse to the directory of this script.
    2.) Type "AnimeTosho-Batch-Downloader.exe" (with the quotes). Press Enter, duh...
    3.) Copy and Paste the link of AnimeTosho page. (For Example : https://animetosho.org/view/animerg-kiss-x-sis-1-12-720p-bd-complete-jrr.960922)
    4.) Press Enter and sit back and watch this little script do the rest of the job.
    5.) The files will be in the same folder. Read the BUGS/Knows Issues section (below).

 
   # For Linux/Mac ~ Python Script User :

    1.) Run the Python script in a terminal, so you know what happened if anything went wrong.
    Then copy steps 3 - 5 from above.



#NOTE:- I'd recommend running it in a cmd/terminal. In case, something messed up, you can send me a screenshot of the error.


# Features To Come / Planned Updates

1.) To show how much time is left in completing the file download.

2.) Pause/Resume function.

3.) Adding downloads from more hosts.

4.) Skip the file, if the download has expired.


# Bugs/Known Issues

1.) If the file is NOT present on solidfiles, this app wil crash straight.

2.) If there's an expired link in pile of 20 links, you can't download shit.

3.) Only downloads from SolidFiles is supported currently.

4.) Script sometimes bugs out, because of un-known problems.
